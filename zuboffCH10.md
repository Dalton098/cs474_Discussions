“Sensors are used to modify people’s behavior just as easily as they modify device behavior. There are many great things we can do with the internet of things, like lowering the heat in all the houses on your street so that the transformer is not overloaded, or optimizing an entire industrial operation. But at the individual level, it also means the power to take actions that can override what you are doing or even put you on a path you did not choose.”

Zuboff opens from this quote from a senior engineer. This quote emphasizes what Zuboff is talking about when it comes to action/actuation. The engineer is saying that they have so much power already that they are capable of taking actions that can disregard what you are doing and even change your entire direction. I am not sure whether this is blown out of proportion or not to make it more jarring but if this is the truth then this is bad. I would consider this technology to still be relatively young and if they are already capable of something like this then I am not excited to see what the future holds for us unless regulations are put in soon.

“The allure of surveillance revenues drives the continuous accumulation of more and more predictive forms of behavioral surplus. The most predictive source of all is behavior that has already been modified to orient toward guaranteed outcomes.”

This highlights why companies are swapping to surveillance methods to generate revenue. The best type of revenue is predictable revenue that is guaranteed. Companies are constantly taking risk when they come out with a new product or app because they are unsure if it will succeed but now with this behavioral modification they can guarantee success. So essentially they are lower the risk they take and increasing the reward.
