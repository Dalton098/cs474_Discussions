“The result is the application of instrumentarian power to societal optimization for the sake of market objectives: a utopia of certainty.”

The goal of instrumentarianism is to treat society like a Computer Science problem. They are searching for an algorithm that will create an optimal society for them. Their goal with this optimization to grant obtain the ability to predict how people will act. They want this certainty so that no matter what they can be ahead and can act according to the actions that they predict so that they are always successful. However, this power is different than just simple prediction. It is the ability to adjust the present so that the future is what they expect.

“We could probably solve a lot of the issues we have as humans.”

This is a quote from Larry Page that Zuboff cited in reference to machine learning and society. The question I have in relation to this quote is who decides what is an issue with a human? What one person may see as a flaw or issue could be a part of someone that another person cherishes. In terms of medical issues this could be okay but I feel like Page was not talking about medical issues when he said this. I think that technology has solved some issues but as a result created unintended new issues.
