Zuboff focuses on “will” and specifically what our “will” does in terms of determining our future.

Also, Zuboff talks about a “new contract form” which is, “Nowadays it’s a lot easier just to instruct the vehicular monitoring system not to allow the car to be started and to signal the location where it can be picked up.”

What this new contract form does is it provides the seller with more security than the consumer. If the consumer faults on the contract they are hit with the punishment of breaking the contract. The seller can have immense knowledge about the consumer and as a result make sure the people they make contracts with will perform the promise they signed into with the contract. This is called “contract utopia” by Zuboff.

“Surveillance capitalists’ interests have shifted from using automated machine processes to know about your behavior to using machine processes to shape your behavior according to their interests.”

Essentially, the data collection they have done up to this point has been the ground work for the next step which is shaping our behavior. By having so much data about how we behave they can now use this data to understand what they need to do to shape our behavior so that it will benefit their company. This takes away from the will of a person because instead of the person making the decision on their own terms they do it because of the nudges from Surveillance capitalists. This is a grim future to see starting to unfold.
