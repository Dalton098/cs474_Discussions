“On the other side of the equation, render also describes the way in which the thing that is changed gives itself over to this process: it sur-renders. … By the fourteenth century, the word also incorporated the idea of handing over, delivering, or acknowledging dependency or obligation, as in “Render unto Caesar.”

I found this discussion on the double meaning of rendering to be interesting, especially in reference to human experience. As user we are impacted by both meanings from surveillance capitalist. For the first meaning, the technologies of surveillance capitalism render our experience into data that they can use for their own means. For the second meaning, when we use their technologies we are letting our experience become data and “rendering unto surveillance capitalism” this data. Zuboff reminds us of the Aware Home which was a technology that used rendition without surveillance capitalism but surveillance capitalism cannot exist without rendition.

“What Angle neglected to say was that a customer who refuses to share his or her home’s interior mapping data with iRobot also loses most of the smart functionality of the “autonomous” vacuum cleaner, including the ability to use one’s phone to start or pause a cleaning, schedule cleanings, review “Clean Map reports,” receive automatic software updates, or start a “SPOT Clean to focus on a particularly dirty area.”

The whole section about iRobot was particularly uncomfortable to read. It mentioned them planning to add a camera to the Roomba which is beyond disturbing. The idea of things like Alexa or Google Home constantly listening is already weird enough but having my vacuum cleaner film me is a new level. iRobot stated that the user would have to consent in sale of their data but there was no one to actually opt out of data collection. If you choose not to have your data sold then it is still collected and stored in the cloud so you can view it on your mobile device. If I had to guess this is still being sold or used in some way. Then we reach the quote above which is truly horrible. If you do not consent to sharing your data then you lose some functionality of the product because you want to have privacy. What is interesting is looking at the functionality that is lost I can’t even see why not sharing your data with other would impede these actions. It seems like the functionality is lost only because they want you to share your data and not because the functionality is dependent on the data.
