Zuboff brings up the question of why is Google, which is a search company, investing in things such as smart homes, wearable devices, and self-driving cars and why is Facebook, a social network, investing in augmented reality and drones. Zuboff makes it clear that this is just another way in which these companies can gather more data about the behavior of humans. The aim of Google is customer satisfaction and the best way to make the customer satisfied is to know more about them, thus leading to capturing more data about their behaviors. While I do understand how this data is useful to expand the user experience I think it  is close to being used in malicious ways. Again I think having this data tracked about you should be something you opt into instead of having no say. This quote on page 136 is very concerning to hear, “Google is under enormous pressure from the financial community to increase the “effectiveness”
of its tracking, so that it can increase revenues and profits. Giving a user the ability to control his
own privacy information (and to protect himself from malware) by blocking invisible connections
to problematic sites constitutes an existential threat to Google.” Google can still function without tracking everyone’s data, it just works better by doing so.
