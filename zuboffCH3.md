Google has been the main source of surveillance capitalism in terms of the invention of it as well as the explorer of it. Google prides itself for being on the forefront of machine intelligence. These machine intelligence operations include things such as algorithmic development and machine learning. The main thing is that these operations convert raw material (our data) into a product that can be used to predict the behavior of the user. One example of this is targeted advertising. At first the data collect by Google was seen as waste or a by product of the search but what they soon realized is that this data could be analyzed and used in a variety of ways for improvement. Zuboff makes it a point to state that Googleâ€™s users are not customers. There is no economic exchange between the user and Google, however Google uses the users as a source of raw material. Originally, all this raw material was only being used for search improvements but this quickly changed. Google turned over the purpose of the data to be used in targeting individuals with specific ads.
