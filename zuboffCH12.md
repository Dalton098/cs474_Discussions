“As to this species of power, I name it instrumentarianism, defined as the instrumentation and instrumentalization of behavior for the purposes of modification, prediction, monetization, and control.”

Zuboff discusses the power the surveillance capitalist wield because of their technologies from behavioral data. The least concerning of these purposes is monetization but the rest of the purposes are concerning because in the wrong hands any of the purposes could easily be used for something because trying to get users engaged in a product.

“Instrumentarian power moves differently and toward an opposite horizon. Totalitarianism operated through the means of violence, but instrumentarian power operates through the means of behavioral modification, and this is where our focus must shift.”

With totalitarianism the power possessed and used was quite literally visible which lends itself to being understood more easily that instrumentarianism. The most worry part about instrumentarianism is that is operates through behavioral modification in an “invisible manner”. It acts as an invisible hand pushing us in a given direction which is much harder to be aware of. The use of behavioral modification also makes it so one must challenge their own thoughts because those thoughts themselves might be due to the result of behavioral modification. Instrumentarianism is a much tougher beast to tackle because it silently oppresses and tampers with our thoughts.
