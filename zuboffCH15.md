The whole idea of Pentland and the instrumentarian industries where he is seen as if he was a high priest to them was a bit weird from Zuboff. I think it is good to draw the connection between the two but imply it as a pseudo-religion does not fit I think. I feel that most religions have a much different goal than these people do.

“As if in response, Pentland and his students have spent the last two decades determined to invent the instruments and methods that can transform all of human behavior, especially social behavior, into highly predictive math.”

I think the biggest part of this quote is predictive math. At the end of the day all these data systems rely on predictions and have some underlying basic assumptions about a given situation. However, that is all they are, a simple prediction with a certain amount of confidence attached to them. No matter how hard they try, their predictions will never be 100% guaranteed to happen because unexpected events can occur or the individual can decide to do something else.



The chapter about the theory behind surveillance capitalist

1. The Priests of Instrumentarian Power
   - Pentland as priest like figure
2. When Big Other Eats Society: The Rendition of Social Relations
   - The creation of instruments to turn social behavior into predicative math
   - Using mobile phones as a means of to mine data from reality
   - Data records our lives/behavior as it actually happens but it can not perceive our thoughts or our perception of these events
   - Sociometric solutions seems weird. The want us to be able to work with individuals that we would get along with better but I think it is important to experience people you don't get along with and learn how to deal with that and experience different view points
3. The Principles of an Instrumentarian Society
   - Behavior For the Greater Good
     - collective behavior is more cohesive
   - Plans replace politics
     - politics creates friction that threatens efficiency
   - social pressure for harmony
     - eliminate emotions that threaten cooperation
     - society shifts to a swarm
   - applied utopistics
     - Create a planned society that controls the means of behavior modification
   - the death of individuality
     - removes the friction of individual rationality
4. The Third Modernity of the Hive
   - Instrumentarianism reimagines society as a hive to be monitored and tuned for guaranteed outcomes, but this tells us nothing of the lived experience of its members.
