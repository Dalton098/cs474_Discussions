The researchers concluded that their global study of students had “ripped back the curtain” on the loneliness and acute disorientation that overwhelm young people when faced with disconnection from social media.

It was quite interesting to see the reactions of these people who had been asked to abstain from social media for a relatively short period but even then they felt withdrawal symptoms in a way. I personally have chosen to avoid having social media as much as possible because, when I did have social media I felt these same feelings that the teenagers in this research did. I felt a reliance on it and felt I was missing something if I did not check it. I plan on removing social media even more from my life after college but for now I use it to communicate with some people so I keep it to talk to them.

“The goal was to keep users glued to the hive, chasing those hits while leaving a stream of raw materials in their wake.”

The relationship between social media and the user is mutually beneficial. The user gets the benefit of the dopamine rush from likes and feeling like their fitting in while the surveillance capitalist are able to collect data. Social media is designed so that the user cannot give up social media easily because if they could then these companies would be losing their costumer as well as their source of data. It is interesting to think that all these programs are designed not to have some form of value that keeps bringing you back but rather they want you to feel compelled to come back psychologically because that is more certain.
