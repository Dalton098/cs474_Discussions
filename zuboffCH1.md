When the reading talked about the Nest thermostat is was disturbing to read about how that information was being shared around by google to various other companies. This is personal data that can easily be used for wrong doing such as breaking into a house when you know their schedule would have them out of the house. I feel like this almost disregard for the user’s privacy is deeply concerning and I wish the assumption of the Aware home had been kept, more specifically the part about it being a closed loop system. When talking about surveillance capitalism and how companies are now trying to “automate” use, this is quite unsettling to hear. The companies want to control our behavior/manipulate us in such a way that it benefits their profits. That sounds exactly what a dystopia is.
