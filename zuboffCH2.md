When Apple entered the music industry it sounds like they took advantage of the group that had been using Napster as their new customer base. The same can be said for when Netflix came around. People had been pirating movies and shows but now that their was a legal and reasonable way to obtain movie and shows people were willing to pay to get access to the content they had been getting for free up until then because the service was worth the price and less of a hassle than pirating was. It is scary to think this success seen in both Apple and Netflix has also been used by surveillance capitalist to root themselves into most of our modern internet infrastructure. The rise of Google and Facebook being used daily by almost everyone highlights how deeply rooted they are. One part of the reading that really surprised me was when talking about identity and the author speaks about how now a days people suffer from having too many choices and not knowing who they should be but in the past people suffered because they had inhibitors blocking them from being who they should be.



Chapter 5 of Hooked talks about Investment. One thing I found particularly interesting was the fact that we over value our own efforts. I had heard about this before this chapter with things such as the sunk cost fallacy and talks about video game addiction. It is interesting and a bit scary to think that this can be applied by businesses to hook the user even more. The author also talks about setting up external triggers to bring back the user. This comes in the form of using the userâ€™s past behavior to cause an external trigger in the future. With Any.do this seems like a good thing on how they use triggers. The goal of the app is task management so by getting people to regularly use the app they could end up becoming more organized. This example of using the Hooked principles seems to be for good in comparison to most other uses.
