When Apple entered the music industry it sounds like they took advantage of the group that had been using Napster as their new customer base. The same can be said for when Netflix came around. People had been pirating movies and shows but now that their was a legal and reasonable way to obtain movie and shows people were willing to pay to get access to the content they had been getting for free up until then because the service was worth the price and less of a hassle than pirating was. It is scary to think this success seen in both Apple and Netflix has also been used by surveillance capitalist to root themselves into most of our modern internet infrastructure. The rise of Google and Facebook being used daily by almost everyone highlights how deeply rooted they are. One part of the reading that really surprised me was when talking about identity and the author speaks about how now a days people suffer from having too many choices and not knowing who they should be but in the past people suffered because they had inhibitors blocking them from being who they should be.
