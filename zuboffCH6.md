Zuboff opens the chapter by talking about conquest by declaration. She uses Christopher Columbus as an example to further help us understand the concept. Zuboff states the harm of declarations by saying “Declarations are inherently invasive because they impose new facts on the social world while their declarers devise ways to get others to agree to those facts.” From what we have read so far we can clearly see where this is going. There were 6 declarations that were pulled out of thin air by Google. From these six declarations the age of surveillance capitalism was introduced. Google does not require the users trust it just uses declarations as a means to amass more knowledge and power. Zuboff later describes two text. The first text is the outward facing text which is what users add to the internet and similar. The second text, the “shadow text”, is hidden from the public and only viewed by the surveillance capitalist. The second text is comprised of information that is mined from the first text. It consistent of behavior data and analyses of the first text.



This chapter focused on the use of the Hook Model in a real world application, YouVersion. The author states “It wasn’t until we tried a mobile version that we noticed a difference in people, including ourselves, turning to the Bible more because it was on a device they always had with them.” I thought this was interesting because this really highlights the part of the Hook Model about the user needing to have the ability to complete an action. The ability to access the app at all times was a complete game changer in making YouVersion work and gain popularity. It is interesting to read about this app because this is a case where I would say that the techniques being used from the Hook Model are being done for good. The app helps assist people in accomplishing the goal they have set out to do.
