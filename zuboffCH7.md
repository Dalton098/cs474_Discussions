One quote that really stuck out to me was “The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They
weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” This is already becoming true of surveillance capitalisms means of collecting data. The collection of data does not interfere with the user experience in anyway and is only used to “enhance” their experience. This quote is brought up in reference to Schmidt talking about “the end of the internet” but rather what he meant was the assimilation of the internet into our life so deeply that we cannot even tell it is there anymore. Later, Zuboff discusses that the goal of the collection of data is not for conformity but rather to produce behavior that is consistent and beneficial for making money. Also, Zuboff discusses how the introduction of sensors everywhere is essentially inevitable at our current pace.
