This chapter opens with a quote and part of it says “Your whole life will be searchable.” Personally, I do not want this. I do not have anything in particular I want to hide but just that fact that my life is so accessible by people and companies I do not know makes me uncomfortable. Being searchable means that it can be easily processed to find various important points, which again I think is weird for someone I do not know to have access to. For someone to learn about my life they should have to know me and either experience my life with me or have me be the one that decides to tell them more information. It should not just be tracked data that I have no control over. Later, Zuboff also mentions how we are exiles from our own behavior and how we are denied access or control over the knowledge that is derived from us. This control is left to companies and to them we are just a resource. Even though I accept that the processing of our data can in turn create wonderful services and better user experience I still believe the user should be allow to sign off on whether or not data is collected about them and how it can be used.



This chapter focuses on what to do with the Hook Model. The author talks about the morality of manipulation. They bring up a good point about manipulation being used as both a good and bad thing. For example Weight Watchers uses manipulation but is seen as a good way of using it where as a addictive video game is not. While I generally do not like the idea of manipulation I do agree with the author that it can be used in some cases for good. I think when manipulation is used in such a way that it gets the consumer/user to do something that betters themselves, such as losing weight. However, manipulation can easily go astray. An example would be video games which are loaded with manipulative mechanisms that encourage the user to spend more money and time on the game. I think in this manner manipulation can be very detrimental because once a person realizes they have been manipulated they have to actively put energy into breaking the cycle. Video game addiction is a relatively new problem and I believe has developed partially because of all the manipulative mechanisms inside video games.
